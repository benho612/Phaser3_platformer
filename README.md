## 🧪 Development Notes

- Built using **Phaser 3**, JavaScript, and HTML5 canvas
- Uses Phaser’s **Arcade Physics** system for movement and collision
- Enemy paths are defined with `Phaser.Curves.Spline` for smooth movement
- Clean restart is handled via `resetGameState()` on scene start

## To Do / Ideas

- Add animated intro or attract screen
- Show “You Win” or “Game Over” depending on how the game ends
- Save and display a high score across runs
- More complex boss mechanics (multiple phases, health bar)
